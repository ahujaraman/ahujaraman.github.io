- name: Enhanced Naive Bayes Model in NLP for Sentiment Analysis
  i18n: thesis
  gh_user: ahujaraman
  repo: bayes_sentiment_analysis
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/sentiment_analysis.png
  desc: 'Developed a novel approach for improving the accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. Factored in methods like effective negation handling, word n-grams and feature selection by mutual information and observed amalgamation of these results in a significant improvement in accuracy. We achieved an accuracy of 85.0% on the popular IMDB movie reviews dataset. Thus built a highly accurate and fast sentiment classifier which has linear time training and testing time complexities which is at par to the start-of-the-art SVM models. <b> The proposed method can be generalized to a number of text categorization problems for improving speed and accuracy.</b> <br /> Tools & Implementation - Java, StanfordCoreNLP, Text Pre-Processing, Feature Engineering, Feature Extraction. <br /> Dataset - <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/">Stanford Large Moview Review Dataset</a>'

  desc: 'Goal is to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm built will take a webpage session (a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether it belongs to genuine person or somebody else. Have done feature-engineering based on sequential pattern mining techniques to enhance ROC AUC. <br / > Tools - Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. <br /> Dataset - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/data">Blaise Pascal University proxy servers</a>'
